# Project Abstract
TensorMap is a web application that will allow the users to create machine learning algorithms visually. TensorMap supports reverse engineering of the visual layout to a Tensorflow implementation in preferred languages. 
The goal of the project is to let the beginners play with machine learning algorithms in Tensorflow without less background knowledge about the library. 
The main goal of this year's contribution was to make the TensorMap application bug free with clearly documented steps for setup. Also I added some new features to the existing app to make it more user friendly.

# Work Summary
There were multiple changes to be done to the TensorMap project in order to make it easier to setup and use. I made sure to simplify the code base and fix the project architecture where necessary. After implementing those changes, I added some new features to the app. Finally, I added linting and testing frameworks to the project to make future contributions more convenient. 
* Discussed what needs to be fixed first in the App
* Fixed incompatibility warnings
* Addressed the issues in the current version of TensorMap
* Added new features to the App
* Test the implemented functions
* Kept the mentors up to date about the progress
* Demonstrated the work done and attended meetings with the mentors

# What Covered
The tasks I completed during GSoC '23 are listed below.
* Fix Setup Issues & warnings
* Prevent app from failing silently
* Simplified and refactored the codebase
* Re-create the frontend of the Drag and Drop canvas using ReactFlow
* Fixed the UI inconsistencies
* Implemented model creation using the JSON correctly
* Added proper model validation at the backend
* Addressed state management issues in the front end
* Re-designed and simplified the model training process
* Added dataset metrics display to the Data Process page
* Added linting to the project
* Initialized the test frameworks for the frontend and backend

# What left
* Create detailed user & contributor guides
* FIx linting issues
* Add support to more data types, model types
* Add user validation and other security features
* Dockerize the project for easier setup
