# Project Name
Codelabz
# Project Abstract
CodeLabz is a platform where users can engage with online tutorials and organizations can create tutorials for the users. Currently, the Project doesn't use dynamic data, Some pages are inconsistent with the design system, and new pages are required. This project focuses on making the necessary UI changes to the websites and also creating a proper functional backend using Firebase services to make the site functional and deploy the first working prototype of the site.
